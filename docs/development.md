# SDS Development

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/microsoft/secure-data-sandbox/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/microsoft/secure-data-sandbox)

## Quick Start

* Create a [Visual Studio Codespaces](https://online.visualstudio.com) instance with no selected repository
* Enter the following commands

```shell
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/secure-data-sandbox
cd secure-data-sandbox

# Install dependencies and link projects
npm install

# Run tests
npm run test
```

## Prerequisites

To fully develop and debug SDS, you'll want to have the following installed on your `PATH`

* Node 12+
* Docker
* Helm 3
* Azure CLI

## Azure development

The `Laboratory` and `Worker` communicate via Azure Storage Queue. To set up a queue for use with local development, follow the steps below

```shell
# Choose a unique name for your storage account
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=sdsdev
REGION=westus2

# Create a Storage Account and queue
az group create -n sds-dev -l $REGION
az storage account create -g sds-dev -n $AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT --sku Standard_LRS
az storage queue create -n runs

# Create a Service Principal with permissions
QUEUE_ID="$(az storage account show -n $AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT --query id -o tsv)/queueServices/default/queues/runs"
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role 'Storage Queue Data Contributor' --scopes $QUEUE_ID
```

### Laboratory 

#### Environment variables

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and enter the data returned by the CLI. A translation guide for the property names is below

* `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: `tenant`
* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: `appId`
* `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: `password`

#### Running

```shell
# Load the values into your shell
set -o allexport; source .env; set +o allexport

# Start the laboratory
npm run laboratory

# Connect to the laboratory (one-time operation)
npm run cli connect http://localhost:3000
```

## Kubernetes development

The `Worker` component runs on Kubernetes. Follow the instructions below to set up your dev environment

### Initial setup

```shell
# Set up a local k8s cluster using kind
curl -Lo ./kind https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/download/v0.8.1/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
kind cluster create
```

### Configuration

Update `deploy/helm/values.dev.yaml` with the values that match your environment. Specifically, you'll need

* `worker.queueEndpoint`: Point to a queue in your Azure Storage Account
* `identities.*`: Enter values for your own Service Principal(s). The `worker` identity will need the `Storage Queue Data Message Processor` (or higher) role on your queue

### Install SDS

```shell
helm install sds deploy/helm --values deploy/helm/values.dev.yaml
```

### Iterating on the Worker

Rather than build an image, upload it to a registry, then make an update to Kubernetes, you can short-circuit the process by building & directly loading into your kind cluster

```shell
# Update the Worker running in the local kind cluster
./scripts/dev-worker.sh
```

### Viewing workflows

In development mode, SDS installs `argo-server` as a UX to view & troubleshoot Workflows. To access it, run

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n argo svc/argo-server 2746
```

> Note: if you are running in codespaces, you will have to forward port 2746 in VS Code in order to navigate to Argo Server

## Demos

It can be useful to execute the samples rapidly. Scripts are provided to help you exercise the system

* `scripts/sample-data.sh` - Execute the basic YAML files
* `scripts/demo-catdetection.sh` - Run the cat detection demo (see [README](/samples/catdetection/README.md) for setup instructions)

## Auditing Packages

As of Sep 2020, Lerna does not provide a command to audit packages for security vulnerabilities [#1663](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1663). The `scripts` directory contains a convenience script to perform updates. From a fresh clone:

```shell
# Run a global `npm audit fix`
./scripts/dev-npm-audit-fix.sh
```

## Updating Dependencies

It can be difficult to bulk update npm packages across many projects in the monorepo. A script is provided:

```shell
# Run a global `npm update`
./scripts/dev-npm-update.sh
```
