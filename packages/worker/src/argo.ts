   * Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and Int64() accessors.
   *
   * The serialization format is:
   *
   * <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
   *   (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
   * <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
   *   (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
   * <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
   *   (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
   * <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
   *
   * No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
   *
   * When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
   *
   * Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
   *   a. No precision is lost
   *   b. No fractional digits will be emitted
   *   c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
   * The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
   *
   * Examples:
   *   1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
   *   1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
   *
   * Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
   *
   * Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
   *
